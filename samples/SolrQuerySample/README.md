This sample can be run after starting your Solr server using the following command (tested on Solr 5.3.1/6.0.0): 

	bin/solr start -p 8983 -e techproducts
	
If you run locally to your Solr server, the sample should work out of the box. If not, you will need to specify the correct solrURL parameter.
